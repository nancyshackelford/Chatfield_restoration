Our research group is lucky to work and live on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territories of the lək̓ʷəŋən peoples and the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples. We offer gratitude and respect to these Peoples and to their relationship with the lands on which we reside.

Based at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, the Restoration Futures Lab aims to advance our understanding of how to design and conduct successful restoration of ecological communities. Our research investigates the drivers of restoration outcomes, bringing together ecological theory with on-ground results to make restoration more predictable at all scales. We assess how functional traits, landscape context, and environmental variability shape the development of restoration sites, and how this can be generalized across ecosystems globally. This repository is shared privately among our group to ensure high quality data, code, and protocols. Whenever appropriate, completed projects should be uploaded to the Dryad data repository (https://datadryad.org/stash) to encourage public access and wider use of data produced by our work.

### Description

This database includes all data produced by the Restoration Futures Lab. Exceptions include any sensitive data collected on human subjects that cannot be fully anonymized. This is a private repository, with only active or recently active (< 5 years) members of the group granted access to the information stored here. However, the main server for GitHub is located in the United States and subject to the Freedom of Information Act. Thus, no sensitive data should be uploaded.

In addition, all data should be the cleaned and curated version of each data set. They should be uploaded at the end of each season or trial, so may not be complete but should be static until the next season or trial.
